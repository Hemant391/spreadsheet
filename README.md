This project is a frontend application that mimics the functionality of a spreadsheet. Built using React.js, Bootstrap, and Material UI, it allows users to interact with a grid of cells similar to a spreadsheet, with support for cell editing, data persistence, and advanced features like cell formatting, data validation, search,and filter.

Core Features
Grid Rendering: Efficiently renders a grid of 1000 editable cells.
Cell Editing: Allows users to edit the content of each cell dynamically.
Data Storage: Manages the grid data in memory, ensuring persistence during interactions.
Styling: Styled using Bootstrap with custom CSS to distinguish cells and provide a clean interface.
